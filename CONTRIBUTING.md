- Next, select this button on the upper right to get your own mirror/fork of the repository.

- After getting your fork, you need to clone it to your local machine to edit.
    - For this step it is easiest to use [Github Dekstop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- Once cloned locally your ready to make changes using any one of the many editors for Markdown.
    - We recommend [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

    - More info on proper Markdown formatting below.

> ***Be sure to keep your repository current with the master. Info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) or if using GitHub Desktop [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/syncing-your-branch/).***
    
## Formatting
The wiki uses [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/).

Markdown is very easy to use as it just uses simple symbols to format text. **For example:**
