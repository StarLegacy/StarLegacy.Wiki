First and foremost, welcome to Star Legacy. Your convoy has been attacked by a pirate fleet and in an attempt to escape, you hopped on a ship which carried you to Sobrii system. Now a refugee, you've lost all your possessions and need to start over in this strange galaxy. 

If you are here to edit the wiki, this is for you. Otherwise, please continue as you were. Do not troll, delete others info with permission, or create useless pages. This will earn you a one time warning and then a site ban upon second offense. 

## Getting Started

The interstellar government has provided you a starting balance from their refugee funds. Use it to acquire a ship from the ship dealer and head for a planet of liking. '''However, we strongly encourage you to go through the tutorial before buying your first ship as on obtaining your first ship, you will be teleported directly to it.''' Note: You also need to wear the space suit (chain armor) provided. Should you lose your space suit, you can always acquire a new one using `/kit space`. You can use the [Map (http://starlegacy.enjin.com/map)](http://starlegacy.enjin.com/map) to navigate the systems (Accessible in-game with `/map`). You can find yourself on the map by hovering over the little arrow on the right, then going to the player list on the bottom of the panel, and clicking on your name. If you don't see your name, try clicking the down arrow at the bottom of the player list to scroll down. Pick a [[Planets|planet]] to go to where you can start setting up a base. 

### Flying a ship
After acquiring a ship, you need to first "re-detect" the ship. To do this you need to **left-click** with your clock on the starship computer. The starship computer looks like this:

https://gyazo.com/c4f2b1849aee8a9a686b5f9ffc1eb514.png

You will have to search your ship near the cockpit to find it. For a Speeder it will be under the chest at the back of the ship. For a shuttle it is under a carpet with a sign on it that says Heavy Shuttle.

In the GUI you will see several options. Here you can choose to add pilots by clicking the add-pilot option then typing into chat the players name. This is also the place you can lock your ship. Locking your ship means no one other than you can access it. This includes stopping people from stealing your ship, greifing your ship, stealing items from your ships chest. (This option will not work if there are multiple pilots of the ship) The final option in the GUI is Ship Type. This s how you get different size, and powerful ships. Click on the option, this will open another GUI with a list of ships you have unlocked. (To unlock more ships you have to rank-up) Every ship has a minimum and maximum block amount. Your ship has to fit the minimum and maximum limit to be able to become that type of ship. For example for a shuttle or a starfighter the ship you are detecting must be 100 -> 500 blocks. 

*Note: To detect the ship properly the type of ship option must be chosen first to accommodate the size of your ship.

To pilot your ship, you need to right-click the starship computer with a clock in your hand. To be able to do this you have to left click the ship, choose the type of ship you want it to be (see above paragraph for more info) then press redetect. You will use your clock in conjunction with your ship in all things. You will use the clock to access the ship computer GUI, pilot the ship, shoot the ships weapons, and turn. 

To bring a passenger with you you must first stop flying the ship. The passenger than has to enter the ship and stand inside it. Then the captain repilots the ship and the passenger boards the ship. You will know for sure if the passenger has boarded the ship by looking in chat for a statement like this:
https://gyazo.com/d0301b27e37369256c421a0c270b9efe.png

After piloting the ship, you can move your ship around. There are 3 ways to move your ship:

#### 1. "Shift" Flying

Shift flying allows you to move quickly over short distances, and quickly change directions. Hold the clock in your hand and look in the direction you want to move in. Then hold the sneak key (by default, shift, hence the name). You can face in any direction. This means you can move horizontally, vertically, and at a diagonal. 

*Note: You must be piloting the ship before you can perform any ship manovours. 

#### 2. Cruising

Cruising is the best way to move over longer distances, like getting across a planet, going from the eco station to a planet, or traveling between planets. 

To cruise either right click the sign with [cruise] on it or type in chat the command: /cruise
(To make a cruise sign, place a sign that says [cruise] on line 1 and right-click it)

Your ship needs time to accelerate to a target speed while cruising. The speed you cruise at and acceleration is determined by your [[Thrusters|thrusters]]. To cruise, use right-click on the cruise sign while facing the direction you want to go in, this can also be done by facing the direction you want to go in and typing into chat /cruise.
You can cruise sideways and diagonally but it is most effective when going in a direction facing the opposite way of the engines. 

#### 3. Steering

Using the helm of your starship, you can rotate it right or left 90 degrees. To use it, right-click the sign to turn right, or left-click to turn left. The ship will rotate according to the sign block as the center. (To make a helm sign, place a sign that says [helm] on line 1 and right-click it). You can also, while holding a clock in your hand and piloting the ship, press F and Q to turn your ship. F will turn left and Q will turn right.
#### Tips
 - If there is a block in the way of your ship, you cannot move it in that direction.
 - Stained glass blocks act as hangars - you can fly through them!
 - Remember to click on your name on the map again after going through a world transfer! (i.e. entering a planet)
 - To release your starship, type `/release` or right click the starship computer.
 - To protect your ship's contents, you can enable starship lock on the computer GUI. You can only have one ship locked at a time!

### Shooting
After learning how to pilot your ship you must now learn how to use it in combat. To shoot heavy weapons such as heavy lasers and torpedoes double right click. There is a cool down on these weapons so you will have to wait until they are reloaded so use them wisely. For weapons such as cannons and pulses normal left click will fire them. Depending on how much energy your ship has and the amount of these weapons you have it'll dictate the cool down for pulses and cannons. 

### What Next
Now that you know the basics of flying a ship, there are a number of things you can do. You can pick a rank track (/ranktrack) (though you should wait till you can handle pirates), you can make money (which is used to rank up if you are a colonist!), you can bake cake, you can build a ship, you can make a claim or start a settlement, you can JOIN a settlement or nation, and you can go check out the creative server!

Picking a rank track is important but you shouldn't do it just yet, as pirates can kill you for points if you do. 

There are several ways to make money. You can trade with other players, ship cargo between the stations (see [https://www.starlegacy.enjin.com/wiki/m/44193093/page/Cargo_Trading here]), or you can sell items to the importer. To see how much an item sells for, use /value. The importer comes in two forms: An NPC named after the system (e.g. "Sobrii Importer") or the importer chest (available in some areas of eco stations). 

If you want to make trade deals with other players, you can join our Discord server and communicate with the hundreds of other players on the server! Invite link: https://discord.gg/RdRCVkM

If you want to join a settlement, you can also join that and go to the #recruiting channel.

If you want to make a small personal claim to protect some stuff, use /claim. To expand it, stand inside it and use /expandclaim. If you want to claim a large plot of land on a planet, use /settlement create <name>. The amount of money it takes depends on the size of a territory, a very small piece of land could be 1,000 credits while a huge one could be as much as 20,000 credits. 

Finally, you can check out the creative server on /server creative. By default, you can claim one alpha plot (a 64x64 plot). You can donate for bigger plots at https://www.starlegacy.enjin.com/shop . If you want some inspiration, it is recommended that you go to /warp spaceplots and see what other people have built.

### Getting to Planets
In the system you start in there are several planets. Open the map (/map) and look at the system on the top left, where you start. Find a planet and see which way to go to get to, then fly to its icon. To enter a planet just fly into it. Once you get there, make sure that you don't land in claimed land - you won't be able to build there.
### Getting to Neighboring Systems
In other systems like Frigus and Ignum, you may find interesting planets with items that cannot be found in Sobrii. To get there, you will need a [[Hyperdrives|hyperdrive]]. A hyperdrive runs on Cheterite for fuel, which can be mined on asteroids. With your hyperdrive fueled and ready, head to one of the hyperspace beacons of the corresponding system you're heading to. These beacons look like nether portals on the map. To use the hyperdrive at these beacons you must fly very close to the beacon which is a space station. When you get close enough in chat a message will pop up telling you to accept or deny the hyperspace jump to the solar system it is designated to send you to. With help of the hyperdrive, you can also establish trade routes between systems which import and export crates from or to other systems. For more info, check out [[Cargo_Trading|the page on cargo trading]]. Once you've unlocked a [[Navigation_Computers|navigation computer]], you can use it to go through hyperspace to any point in space. However, you may get caught in mass shadows like dark matter, planets, or stars. The best way remains to be using hyperspace beacons.

### Cryopod
Now that you're on a planet, you should build [s]wall[/s] a cryopod. A cryopod is where you'd respawn if you die. If a cryopod gets destroyed, obstructed, or moved, you will respawn at the eco station instead. You also can not have more than one cryopod active at one time. You can acquire the basic materials you need from `/kit cryo`. (7 day cooldown) After building your cryopod, put a sign with "[cryopod]" on the first line and right-click on the sign to activate it. Below is the simplest basic design for a cryopod. You should cover your cryopod with more blocks or even hide it to prevent it being destroyed. For more info use `/info cryopod`
- Note: Cryopods can be placed on ships.

### Re-textured blocks
In this server you may encounter several different terms used for blocks and new minerals alike. To maximize your experience, it is recommended to use the provided server resource pack which can also be downloaded offline [https://github.com/Miclebrick/StarLegacyResourcepack/blob/master/StarLegacyPack.zip?raw=true here].
Here's an example of blocks which have been re-textured or renamed:
https://i.imgur.com/rxwpHkc.png
Left to right:
* Starship Computer (Jukebox), Sponge (Technical Block), End Rod (Wire), Redstone Lamp (Tier 2 Thruster), Glowstone (Tier 1 Thruster).
* Piston, Furnace, Crafting Table (Extractor), Graxene Powder (Concrete Powder), Coal Ore.
* Dropper, Dispenser, Iron Block, Carbyne (Concrete), Coal Block.
* Copper Ore, Aluminum Ore, Chetherite Ore, Titanium Ore, Uranium Ore.
* Copper Block, Aluminum Block, Chetherite Block, Titanium Block, Uranium Block.
**Note: Iron bars and Stone bricks are also retextured

### Added Crafting Recipes
* Sea Lantern can be crafted out of 4x Focusing Lens (Prismarine Crystals) and vice versa.
* [[Power_Gear|Power Gear]].
* Copper, Aluminum, Chetherite, Titanium, and Uranium Blocks out of 9x of each respective item.
* 16x Wire (End Rod) can be crafted out of 3x Copper Ingots.

### Ranks and Advancements
Meanwhile, you should decide on a [[Ranks|rank path]] (`/ranktrack`).

After choosing a rank path, you may now earn points. Points can be used to rank up, unlocking bigger ship types and making higher tier advancements available to unlock. Colonists get points by getting money (money = points, losing money = losing points and ranking up takes money) and pirates/privateers get points from kills.

Advancements are unlockable technologies which can be implemented to your ship, defenses, or automatons (more on that later). They also cost points to unlock, increasingly more expensive the higher the tier. Advancements can be implemented on ships, defenses, and automatons. [Click here to jump to Advancements](#main-features).

### Claiming Land
Now with a base set up you should protect it using GriefPrevention, or GP for short. You can do a basic claim using `/claim`. To do more advanced stuff like custom sizes and shapes, you'll need a golden shovel (gold can be acquired on asteroids). You may only have one GP claim in a world, but you can expand them later with a golden shovel. For more info, you should check out the tutorial in this [video on YouTube](http://bit.ly/mcgpuser).

> Warning: Claiming an area to protect a ship while in space is against the rules! Only use claim to protect your builds. However, you may still park your ship within this area, given that it's within your build area i.e. your base.''
