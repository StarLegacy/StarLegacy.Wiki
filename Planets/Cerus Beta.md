## Quick Notes

Cerus Beta has no atmosphere; thus no air. You need a space suit or environmental helmet outside. Slime covers a lot of the land there and isn't friendly. There are huge caves under the map in certain places as well as craters containing iron. Many view it as a worthless planet and only good for trading and slime. Cerus Beta is also smaller than most planets. Due to this, it has less gravity.
