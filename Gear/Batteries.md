# Batteries 

Batteries are used to provide small amounts of power in a portable way.

- Charge them with a charger and then use them on a device (eg Starship Drills) to transfer power.
- To use them alt click on the sign that needs fuel with a battery.
- Batteries of the same type and power value can stack up to 16.
